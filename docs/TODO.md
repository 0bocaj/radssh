# RadSSH To Do List
Or at least "To Consider"

 - [ ] Robust test suite
 - [ ] Make use of Paramiko SSH Config handling
 - [ ] Preserve/restore Cluster object settings via context managers
 - [ ] CI (Travis?)
 - [ ] Executor classes for most of API
 - [ ] Command Translation via Plugins
 - [ ] Interactive input support(?)
 - [ ]     (Or at least handle sudo via SUDO_ASKPASS mechanism)
 - [ ] ECDSA key support
 - [ ] GSSAPI Authentication 
 - [ ] Only use ANSI escape sequences on platforms that support/want it
